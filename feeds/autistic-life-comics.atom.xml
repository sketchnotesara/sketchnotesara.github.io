This license is designed to cater for online and educational usecases while being quite strict about printing my comics. For all details please read the full license and if you have any questions please do get in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to use my comics according to the license, there is a handy package available for download at &lt;a href="https://ko-fi.com/s/f64138f61a"&gt;my Kofi-page&lt;/a&gt;, with both the english and the german version of all the comics in it. If you can afford it, you can support me by paying a small amount on the download page, but the package can also be downloaded for free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Autistic Life Comics"></category></entry><entry><title>Exhibition: Mein Leben als Autistin at PHBern</title><link href="https://www.sketchnotesara.ch/exhibition-mein-leben-als-autistin-at-phbern.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-08-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sara</name></author><id>tag:www.sketchnotesara.ch,2024-08-30:/exhibition-mein-leben-als-autistin-at-phbern.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Exhibition took place at the Von Roll Campus in Bern and was coorganised with Susanne Enggist from the Institut für Heilpedagogik.
