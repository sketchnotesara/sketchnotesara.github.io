Some of the results were featured in the exhibition that started the next day. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Workshops"></category></entry><entry><title>Workshop sketchnoting for autistic adults with AspiesDS 2022 in Bern</title><link href="https://www.sketchnotesara.ch/workshop-sketchnoting-for-autistic-adults-with-aspiesds-2022-in-bern.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-04-01T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Sara</name></author><id>tag:www.sketchnotesara.ch,2022-04-01:/workshop-sketchnoting-for-autistic-adults-with-aspiesds-2022-in-bern.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2022 I did a fantastic workshop with autistic adults in Bern for &lt;a href="www.aspies.ch"&gt;Aspies Deutschschweiz&lt;/a&gt;.

In the second half of the workshop we got together and planned and realised a poster for an upcoming event of the organisation where non autistic people could ask autistic people questions. It was a very interesting afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Workshops"></category></entry></feed>
